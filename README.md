# Execute-commands-on-group-of-machines-by-SSH
# Since I got a project that I need to install multiple deploys and softwares on a group of machines
# I realized that I need a program to do it automatically
# Thats why I make this  part of code
# This program allow you to do multiple commands on multiple machines
# I suppose you have already install SSH on your machines
# If your machines have better CPU, you can change the number of threads
